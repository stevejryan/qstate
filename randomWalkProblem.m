% Problem Description:  Starting from the origin O, a particle moves 
% randomly +/- 1 step along each axis of an N-dimensional space. The 
% probabilities of stepping +1 or -1 step along each axis are each 50% and 
% are statistically independent of each other. After a step is taken, the 
% move is repeated from the new position, and so on. If the walk continues 
% forever, what is the probability that the particle ever returns to the 
% origin O if N = 1, 2, and 3? Please solve this problem numerically and 
% send us your code and a brief summary of your solution and findings.
% Hint: The problem has an analytical solution. Please use the analytical 
% solution to verify or discuss your numerical approach. [Link to
